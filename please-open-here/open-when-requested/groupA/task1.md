## 🛠 What You Can Do

✅ "You do not need to send any new API requests yourself. We’ve already set up a script that sends out sample requests automatically — it’s called do-not-modify.js."
✅ You **can**:
- Modify the code to assist your investigation (e.g., add timestamps, print markers, etc.) and rerun the code if you need. (make sure to run node ./do-not-modify.js as well)

  **Make sure you are in the right directory**
  ```
  cd ./please-open-here
  ```
  **Please execute the following script when you modify server.js** 
  ```
  npm run start-server
  // open other terminal and run
  node ./do-not-modify.js 
  ```
